Innovative idea: The RPG(Role Playing Game) Is a genre of video games where the player focuses on player a character, or role, and the game is framed around this centeral experience This has never really been applied to the casino and gambling video game genre, mainly due to there being real money involved. Our idea would give players in a more simulated and arcade enviornment to play poker, while winning hands gains skill points, which can be used to unlock abilities, such as pocketing an Ace, starting with more money, or bribing the dealer to guarentee a certain river card. As the player gains cash, they can play at riskier tables, until eventually facing the casino pit boss
