## Innovative Idea

On the internet, we are able to see applications that are able to take data and sort using several sorting algorithms. While
this is a cool idea, we wanted to take this idea and bring it up a level. To do this we are adding a new factor: Images! With our
application, we will be able to learn about the runtime of many sorting algorithms including but not limited to:
- Bubble Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Selection Sort

In order to see the speed of our algorithms we will be randomizing the pixels of the images and display in real time the speed it takes for the algorithm to 
piece back our image. Sounds too good to be true? We think not. 

## Important Components
### Image Creation
- This function will design add a new canvas for which we are able to display the shuffled image

### Sorting Algorithm
- We will be implementing several sorting algorithms that will take in the pixels with a given value of locaiton as an input and return the value of these pixels in the correct order

### Display
- In order to display the images as we go, we create a function that will take in an array outputted from a given sorting algorithm and display the iterations of the algorithm
